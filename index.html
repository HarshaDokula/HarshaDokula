   <h1>About Me</h1>

<section>
    <blockquote>
        Hello! I'm Sriharsha Dokula, a passionate software developer with over 3.5+ years of professional experience in automation, identity governance, and full-stack development. My core competencies include Python scripting, REST API integrations, and CyberArk tools.

        Currently, I am working as a Full-Stack Developer at Zapcom, where I focus on designing and developing scalable, web-based applications. My role involves working across the tech stack to deliver robust and user-centric solutions that meet business objectives.

        Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at Binghamton University, collaborating with <a href="https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl/" target="_blank">Prof. David Liu</a> on innovative research in energy-efficient machine learning systems. Notably, I contributed to the project <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11424" target="_blank">Tensor-Aware Energy Accounting</a> aimed at optimizing energy usage in ML frameworks.

        Beyond work, I am an avid follower of Formula 1, fascinated by the blend of speed, precision, and technology. I also enjoy photography and trekking, which offer creative and refreshing escapes from the digital world.

    <h1>About this page</h1>

    <section>
        <p>It's obvious that this page lacks design. This page is not meant for displaying my designing capabilities.
        This was meant to keep it simple and maintainable without great efforts and hence this blandness.</p>
